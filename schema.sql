-- Marketing signals DB (final: variant C + debate amendments). Idempotent: safe to run repeatedly.
-- 5 tables: companies, events, people, scrapes, appearances.  3 views: companies_current, company_history, tech_seen.
-- RLS on, no policies: only the service_role key (server-side) can read/write.
-- Convention: NULL = unknown (fetch/extractor failed). 0 or '{}' = checked and found none.
